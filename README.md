# Cornway's Game of Life - CMD
 This is my own C++ implementation of the Game Of Life from John Cornway.
 This implementation of the game is made through printing ASCII characters on the command prompt. This isn't optimal for the game's performance, but I also made a [SDL2-based version][1] that doesn't need much resources to run.
 Game's speed execution may vary depending on your CPU's performance.
