# Cornway's Game of Life - CMD
 This is my own c++ implementation of the Game Of Life from John Cornway. I'm still learning programming, so don't expect much from it.
This implementation of the game is made through printing ASCII characters on the command prompt. This isn't optimal for the game's performance, but I'm currently working on a GUI-based version that will hopefully be faster.
Game's speed execution may vary depending on your CPU's performance.
